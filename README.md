I'm Meshu Deb Nath, originally from Bangladesh, I moved to Germany for studying a Master's in Web Engineering at Technische UniversitÃ¤t Chemnitz, my goal is to develop front-end and back-end Web Applications (Full-stack) using HTML, CSS & JavaScript as the main front-end stack and NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB & Mongoose as the back-end server-side stack.

I am also looking to contribute to open-source projects to improve my skills and also work on interesting projects that will enhance my skills listed in the Skills section.
